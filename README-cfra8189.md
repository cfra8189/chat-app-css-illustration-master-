My Process
Built with
Semantic HTML5
Bootstrap 5.3 (Grid, Flexbox utilities)
Custom CSS for positioning (position: fixed, transform)
Figma (for design inspiration and asset export)

Asset Creation
The main "phone" asset was exported as a .png file directly from the Figma design file provided in the challenge.

What I Learned
Managing stacking order (z-index) and keeping elements fixed (position: fixed) while the content scrolls over them was a key learning point in this project.

==================================================

***REFLECTIONS***
The challenges that I encountered during the project was converting what I created in Figma in to code. The provide code was enough to start, but it was enough to complete it as quick as I hoped it would have been. I gained valuable experience managing the stacking context of elements using z-index and position: fixed. 

The biggest challenge was correctly positioning the large background graphics halfway off the screen using transform: translateX(), while ensuring the main content remained responsive and centered. I just played around with the percentages until the background graphic behaved the way I wanted and I had to figure out how to keep it in the background without blocking the other elements. Spacing was another big challenge. It seemed like whatever I tried never worked. I would just try the Bootstrap shortcuts like my-2 to adjust the top and bottom margins and p-3 to adjust the padding all round.

The improvements that I would make would be to plan out the design more and do more research on Bootstraps grid system and spacing. Figma is a great tool, but it can be a bit confusing if you don't label the items or the groups. I spent a lot of time going back to see what was what. Bootstrap made things better with those shortcut(I call them). It is interesting to see how much code you can avoid by using Bootstrap.
