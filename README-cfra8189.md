My Process
Built with
Semantic HTML5
Bootstrap 5.3 (Grid, Flexbox utilities)
Custom CSS for positioning (position: fixed, transform)
Figma (for design inspiration and asset export)

Asset Creation
The main "phone" asset was exported as a .png file directly from the Figma design file provided in the challenge.

What I Learned
Managing stacking order (z-index) and keeping elements fixed (position: fixed) while the content scrolls over them was a key learning point in this project.
